# React frontend

Run `nvm use` each time you reopen the frontend directory to switch to the required Node version. (If this version of Node is not already installed, you can run `nvm install` to automatically install and switch to it.)

After cloning this repo, run `npm install` once in this directory to install the required dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the React app in your local browser.
